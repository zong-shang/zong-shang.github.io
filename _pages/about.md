I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at CREST-ENSAE, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, supervised by <a href="https://guillaume-lecue.faculty.essec.edu/">Guillaume Lecué</a> and <a href="https://lerasle.perso.math.cnrs.fr/">Matthieu Lerasle</a>. On this homepage, you can find some of my reflections on mathematical statistics and statistical learning theory.  Starting from the fall of 2026, I will join the School of Mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology as a Visiting Assistant Professor. My mentor will be Vladimir Koltchinskii.
